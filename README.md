# Affirm Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company - Affirm Holdings

* When was the company incorporated? The company was founded 2012 and went public via IPO in 2021. Affirm trades on the NASDAQ under the ticket symbol: AFRM.

* Who are the founders of the company? Max Levchin is the founder and CEO of Affirm Holdings. He co-founded Affirm with Jeffrey Kaditz and Nathan Gettings in San Francisco, CA.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? Affirm was founded to create financial products and services that give power back to the consumer. Affirm's goal is to radically change the banking industry through accountability and accessability. Affirm's buy now/pay later platform provides installment loans to the consumer at the point of sale. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? - Funding: $800 million from Founders Fund, GIC, Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Spark Capital, Thrive Capital and others. Their Series G funding round is their most recent. 


## Business Activities:

* Affirm is working to help customers buy now and pay later without incurring credit card debt and hidden late fees. The company aims to provide an alternative to the traditional credit card model at the POS, enabling the consumer to make their purchase today and make simple monthly payments over a specified time line. 

* In contrast to traditional credit cards, Affirm provides what the user will both owe and what they will pay each month without the hidden fees or compounding interest that credit cards are notorious for. 

* That being said, Affirm's true customer is the merchants that they pair with (ex: Peloton is one of their most notable merchants). The merchant will pay Affirm a fee when Affirm assists in both making the sale and powering the consumer payment for that sale. Affirm claims that they are able to approve roughly 20% consumers for loans than their competitors, which, in turn, allows the merchant to make more sales over time.  

* Affirm's risk model is what they consider to be their competitive advantage. Using their model, Affirm assesses the risk at the transaction level by looking at the particular item that the consumer is looking to purchase. 


## Landscape:

* Affirm falls under the "Payment and Remittances" domain of FinTech, entering as a competitor to traditional loan services and seeking to disrupt this sector of financial services using new technology.

* The impact of Affirm's BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) model, in my opinion, was accelerated due to the covid-19 pandemic. People want to continue working out and staying in shape, but their local gyms were closed. They are interested in purchasing equipment for a home gym, but the price of equipment is too expensive to purchase in one payment. They could potentially leverage a credit card to make the purchase, only to incur high interest rates on the purchase while they try to pay it back. Additionally, given the rise of unemployment due to the pandemic, the idea of making a purchase (like a Peloton, for example) may seem too daunting to undertake.

* The ability for the consumer to purchase the equipment upfront at the POS and knowing exactly what they will owe and when is  a more consumer-friendly, transparent lending model. 

* Other BNPL competitors of Affirm include Klarna, Afterpay, Uplift, and Paypal's BNPL platform called 'Pay in 4'.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? Affirm helps increase a merchant's sales while limiting their risk of the consumer defaulting on the purchase. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? Affirm has a first-mover advantage in the United States, and is globally competing with Sweden's Klarna abd Australia's Afterpay, among others.


## Recommendations

* Right now, while utilizing their first-mover advantage in the BNPL space, the next logical step would be to expand their business into the InsurTech space. Affirm is already using a model to assess the riskiness of loans for the consumer. Why shouldn't they be able to create a similar model to determine the insurability of individuals for insurance companies. Like the BNPL model, the insurance company would purchase the access to use Affirm's proprietary software, and in turn Affirm would be compensated by earning a percentage of the policy premium that the consumer pays to the insurer. This would give the insurance company a better look at the risks of insuring their potential client, and in turn should increase insurance sales for them by using more metrics to assess the risk. Affirm should work to develop specific models for different types of insurance (life, auto, home, etc.) to increase the range of their potential clients. 

* The move into the InsurTech space would allow Affirm to dominate Risk Management across a broader scope of the financial industry. Additionally, while I considered suggesting a move into being a one-stop bank for consumers, incumbent FinTech players like PayPal and Square's CashApp would be difficult for Affirm to overtake.
